		XWNMO - X Input Manager
	     (+ XJUTIL - Dictionary Utility Manager)

This directory contains XWNMO's sources, XJUTIL's sources and multi-automaton's
sources.

	XWNMO - Input Manager for XIM (X Input Method)
	XJUTIL - Dictionary Utility Manager (called by XWNMO)

XWNMO is a input manager offers multi-language input to XIM library of
X11R5 and X11R6. In case of X11R5, the protocol between XWNMO and XIM
library is specified by Xsi Protocol. The Xsi Protocol adopts Back-End
method, because Back-End method is a perfect syncronus comminucation,
so problem of lost key doesn't occur. In case of X11R6, it is specified
by XIM Protocol. The XIM Protocol is a X Consortium Standard. XWNMO
support only back-end method.

For further information about these, please see:
	xwnmo/README and manual of xwnmo	for XWNMO
	xjutil/README and manual of xjutil	for XJUTIL
	X11R5/doc/I18N/Xsi/Xim/XimProto.man	for Xsi Protocol
	X11R6/doc/specs/XIM/xim.ms		for XIM Protocol

Architecture of Input Manager and XIM library.

[Using under X11R6]
¡¦About locale name
  XWNMO uses the following locale names as internal codeset.
      ja_JP.eucJP(Japanese-EUC)
      zh_CN.eucCN(Simplified-Chinese-EUC)
      zh_TW.eucTW(Traditional-Chinese-EUC)
      ko_KR.eucKR(Korean-EUC)
  Some OS have different names even if those have same contents. In those
  case, please mofify ximconf.

¡¦About input of Chinese
  XWNMO(cWnn) use a original codeset, it's called "Sisheng". Fonts for
  "Sisheng" are provided in Xsi/Xwnmo/X11R6/fonts. Those size are 26, 24,
  18 and 16 bots. And must use Xsi/Xwnmo/X11R6/locale/zh instead of
  xc/nls/X11/locale/XLC_LOCALE/zh.

Special thanks to Mr. Bill McMahon of Hewlett Packard. He contributed
toward better portability and reliablity of XWNMO.
