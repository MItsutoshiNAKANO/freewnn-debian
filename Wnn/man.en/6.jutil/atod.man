.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP 0
.IP
atod converts an appropriately formatted euc-encoded dictionary text
from standard input to the binary dictionary format used by wnn.  The
default EUC encoding is UJIS.  To use other euc encodings, you must
set the environment variable CSWIDTH, as described below:

.br
.br
CSWIDTH=b1[:c1][,b2[:c2][,b3[:c3]]]
.br
.br
"b1-b3" are the number of bytes of the code-sets (except SS2 and SS3).
.br
"c1-c3" are the number of columns of the code-sets.
.br
"b1" and "c1"  are for code-set 1.
.br
"b2" and "c2"  are for code-set 2.
.br
"b3" and "c3"  are for code-set 3.
.br

The value of CSWIDTH for UJIS is 2,1,2.

"\fB\-s\fR" specifies the amount of memory to be allocated.  This only
needs to be set if atod exits with an error-message saying that it
does not have enough memory.   In that case rerun it with  more
memory.

atod accepts the following options:
.TP 8
\fB\-s\fR \fIno_of_entries\fR
This should be a number slightly larger than the number of entries in
the dictionary.  The default is 70000.
.TP 8
\fB\-R\fR
Convert the dictionary into a reversible format. (default)
.TP 8
\fB\-S\fR
Convert the dictionary into a fixed format.
.TP 8
\fB\-U\fR
Convert the dictionary into an updatable format.
.TP 8
\fB\-r\fR
Reverse the pronunciation and kanji in the EUC dictionary.
.TP 8
\fB\-P\fR  \fIpassword_fileq \fR 
Specify the password file for the dictionary.
.TP 8
\fB\-p\fR \fIfrequency_password_file\fR
Specify the password file for the frequency file.
.TP 8
\fB\-N\fR
Set the password of the dictionary to "*".
.TP 8
\fB\-n\fR
Set the password of the frequency file to "*".
