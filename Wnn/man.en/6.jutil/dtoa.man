.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP 0
.IP
dtoa converts the specified wnn binary dictionary to a euc-encoded file,
and sends it to stdout.   The default EUC encoding is UJIS.  To
output to other euc encodings, you must set the environment variable
CSWIDTH, as described in atod(1).

The basic output format is:

Pronunciation	Kanji	POS	Frequency


One or more frequency files can also be given as inputs, and they will
be used to calculate the frequency.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Sort the EUC encoded dictionary by pronunciation (long vowel marker
comes first), then hiragana order, then ASCII order.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Add serial numbers to each entry.
.TP 
\fB\-e\fR
Expand special expressions (default).   With this option, spaces, tabs
and so on will be expanded into 8-bit expressions.
.TP 
\fB\-E\fR
Don't expand special expressions.   With this option, spaces, tabs
and so on will not be expanded into 8-bit expressions.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
Specify the POS data file.  The default is
\fI/usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/hinsi.data\fR.
