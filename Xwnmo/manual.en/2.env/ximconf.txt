     In the _x_i_m_c_o_n_f file, configurations of _x_w_n_m_o are wrote.  As
     configurations; environments of each supported languages(the
     relation between internal locale and external locale,
     CSWIDTH(code set width), whether use conversion server or
     not and etc.), default locale and locale for world environ-
     ment.

     Lines that start with a semicolon (;) are comments.

          {ext_locale}[|{ext_locale}|...] {lang}
          {internal_locale} {cswidth} {using_server} {code_trans}
          or
          setdefaultlocale    {def_locale}
          or
          setworldlocale      {world_locale}


     eexxtt__llooccaallee
               Specifies a locale name which is used by client.
               If a client requests _x_w_n_m_o to use the ext_locale,
               _x_w_n_m_o will refer the client to lang,
               internal_locale and etc. in same line. Plural
               ext_locale can be specified with separator '|'.

     llaanngg      Specifies a lang name which is referred as LANG
               name on Wnn environment.  Please refer manuals for
               serverdefs or uumrc of Wnn.

     iinntteerrnnaall__llooccaallee
               Specifies a locale name which is used as internal
               locale by _x_w_n_m_o.  The Wnn library can process only
               EUC encoding. Therefore _x_w_n_m_o must use locales are
               subset of EUC. Must specify locales are subset of
               EUC in internal_locale.

     ccsswwiiddtthh   Specifies CSWIDTH(code set width) of
               internal_locale.  Code format of CSWIDTH follows.
               CSWIDTH=b1[:c1][,b2[:c2][,b3[:c3]]]
               "b1-b3" is byte length of each code set(except SS2
               or SS3).
               "c1-c3" is column length of each code set.
               "b1" and "c1" is for code set 1.
               "b2" and "c2" is for code set 2.
               "b3" and "c3" is for code set 3.

     uussiinngg__sseerrvveerr
               Specifies whether this language environment uses
               its conversion server or not. If ``True'' or
               ``TRUE'' is specified, the conversion server will
               be used.  Otherwise it will not be used. For exam-
               ple; in case of Latin languages, input of those
               languages will be realized with automaton conver-
               sion.

     ccooddee__ttrraannss
               In case of peculiar languages(e.g. Chinese), it is
               necessary to translate internal code to code for
               drawing (e.g. Yincoding of Chinese). In those
               language, code_trans specifies the translation
               method as string.  Otherwise ``Normal'' must be
               specified in code_trans.  Currently, only ``Yin-
               coding'' is support. It is for Yincoding of
               Chinese.

     ddeeff__llooccaallee
               Specifies default locale name. If locale for
               Root-mode is empty or "C" locale, this default
               locale will be used. If def_locale is not speci-
               fied, DEFAULT_LANG will be used as default locale.
               DEFAULT_LANG depends on environment of compiling.
               If you want to know DEFAULT_LANG, set the resource
               langName as NULL, set the environment variable
               LANG as "C" and execute _x_w_n_m_o. Then _x_w_n_m_o will
               print the message "I try to set locale to default
               ???.". This ??? is DEFAULT_LANG.

     wwoorrlldd__llooccaallee
               Specifies locale for world environment. If a
               client requests _x_w_n_m_o to use this world locale,
               _x_w_n_m_o will create multi-language environment for
               the client. If world_locale is not specified,
               "wr_WR.ct" will be used as default.
