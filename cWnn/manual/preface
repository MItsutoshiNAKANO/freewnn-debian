	cWnn is an  integrated Chinese input system  running on Unix  workstation.  It
supports a wide range of input methods, satisfying the needs of the Chinese users from
all over the world, including  P.R.China  and Taiwan.  cWnn is capable of carrying out 
Hanzi conversion  from  an arbitrary  Pinyin or Zhuyin  sequence,  hence improving the 
speed of Pinyin/Zhuyin input.  
	cWnn is developed on  Omron LUNA workstation and has been ported to other Unix
workstations.  It has been released together with X11R5 by X-consortium, MIT. 

	This manual gives a  detailed explanation on how cWnn functions and how it can 
be used.
