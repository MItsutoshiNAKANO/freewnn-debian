©§ 1.1  OVERVIEW  ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿

	This  manual introduces  the  Chinese Input  System, cWnn,  which  runs on Unix 
workstations.  cWnn provides a  wide range of  input methods,  satisfying  the needs of 
Chinese users all over the world, including P.R.China  and Taiwan.  Besides that, it is
capable of converting an arbitrary sequence of Pinyin/Zhuyin into the expected Hanzi.

	Currently, most of the Chinese input systems are developed on personal computers.
In  terms  of all aspects,  personal computers  are  not  as  powerful as  workstations, 
especially in the network capabilities.  With the advance in technology, Unix has begun 
to popularize as it supports  multi-windows, multi-users as well as  multi-environments.
Based on these features, cWnn is developed  to cater for various input methods and other 
useful facilities.

The input methods in cWnn are divided into two categories:

1. Phonetic  
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
This is  a method of inputing Chinese characters using their pronunciations.  The common
phonetic symbols for Chinese are  Pinyin and Zhuyin,  with Pinyin being used commonly in 
P.R China  and  Singapore.  The  Zhuyin  phonetic  symbols  were used  before Pinyin was 
introduced.  It is now currently used in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Currently,  some of the  Chinese input systems  are based on monosyllabic word, that is, 
only a  single Chinese character is input at a time.  There are  also some systems using
Chinese word input.  cWnn, being  different, is able to convert  any arbitrary length of 
Pinyin/Zhuyin  sequence to Chinese  characters at one time.  The  system provides a good 
environment for user input.  It performs an automatic check on  all inputs, making  sure 
that they are legal.  Besides,  cWnn caters for  error tolerance in the  four tones, and
has  standardized  Pinyin  and  Zhuyin,  together  with  the  four tones.  As such, cWnn 
provides an ideal phonetic input environment for the users.

2. Radical 
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
There are several radical methods for  Chinese input, such as Wubi and Cangjie etc.  In 
these  methods, a  Chinese  character is  input by  breaking up  the character into its 
components, which are subsequently entered one by one.  

Currently, a few hundred of such input methods have been developed.  The default radical 
input methods in cWnn are Wubi, Cangjie and Qianma.  However, the system is designed to 
allow any radical input method to be setup easily.


	With  the strong  network capabilities of Unix, together with the multi-user and 
multi-window features, cWnn is able to achieve sharing of resources and at the same time,
supports multi-environments.

©§ 1.3  CWNN SYSTEM STRUCTURE ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿

	cWnn  adopts the  Client-Server Model of  Unix operating  system.  The model is 
made up of a  server and several clients.  One  server can  serve many  clients  at one 
time.  The clients and server processes communicate through a well-defined protocol, but 
are  completely independent.  As  a result, the clients  and server can be on different 
machines communicating across the network, or on the same machine.
	The clients  are the front-end processors  of the system and they interact with 
the users.  The clients execute  on the  Unix shell and  request for services from  the 
server via the socket. 
	On the other hand, the  server will  run as a  background process.  It receives 
service requests from the clients, performs the request, and passes the results back to 
the clients via the socket.  

	The server manages all the resources, such as  dictionaries and usage frequency 
files, and  maintains  different input environments for each of its clients.  The input
environment is  activated by executing the client "cuum".  To the user, each client has 
a different  service environment  which  supports  different input  methods.  Note that
there  may be more than  one server in the network, and each client may in turn obtains 
services from different servers.  
	Hence, cWnn is a  multi-environment  system.  The structure of cWnn is shown in 
the following diagram.

©§ 1.4  FEATURES ON THE SYSTEM STRUCTURE  ©§
©»©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¿

	One  main feature of  cWnn is its  system independency.  Every  environment will 
have  individual environment files  according to the needs of the users.  Each  user may 
specify  his own  environment  setup either  during or  after  system installation.  The 
flexible environment setup includes the following:

1. Input Automaton Setup
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
Input automaton is the  front-end  processor.  It allows  user to specify  his own input 
environment according to his needs.  Through this  setup, Pinyin  input environment  and 
Zhuyin input  environment  may be  specified.  Moreover, interfaces  like  the  keyboard 
setup and function keys can be set.  For more details, refer to Chapter 7.

2. Environment Setup
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
The service  environment of the user is  provided by the server.  It includes the setup 
of conversion  methods,  grammer attributes  and  dictionaries, as well as the setup of 
conversion parameters etc.  These can  be specified before the startup of the front-end 
processor.  Refer to Chapter 5 for detailed descriptions.  Once the front-end is started 
up, the  environment may also be set dynamically via keyboard.  Refer to  Chapter 5 for 
detailed descriptions.

3. Creation of Dictionaries and Grammer Files
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
Dictionaries and grammar files may be created using the utilities provided in the system.
Users are able to  create their own  dictionaries to  suit their needs.  For example, a 
computer professional  may have  his own dictionary  which consists of all the computer 
terms needed.  This dictionary may be added into the system, hence enriching the system 
resources.

4. Encoded Input Method Setup
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
Besides phonetic input  methods, cWnn supports several encoded input methods.  In cWnn,
the default encoded input methods are Wubi, Qianma and Cangjie.  The system is designed
to allow any encoded input method to be installed. 

5. Keyboard Setup
©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥©¥
All the operations in  cWnn's input environment can be carried out by commands.  These 
commands may be set via the keyboard.  Different users have different needs for keyboard 
function.  Hence, by having  different keyboard setup, users are able to have different
user interfaces.  For details, refer to Chapter 5.

NOTE:  Please take note that the  keys used in this manual (eg. PF1, PF2, ^\, ^F ..etc)
       are only the keyboard setup in  cWnn system.  They  may be changed according to
       the user.  Hence, all occurrence of these notations are merely the default setup 
       in cWnn system.
